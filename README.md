## Description

The project is a simple ping pong game that manipulates figures and brings out a list of figures using the **for-loop** method.
First the user is prompted to key in a number of his/her choice. The number is then taken through a loop to verify the output to be displayed.
The number is first checked and if it is a *zero or less* there is no output. If the number is *1 or greater than 1* the number is first taken to a loop that
confirms if it is *divisible by both 3 and 5*. If **yes**, the number is replaced by *pingpong* but if **no**, the number goes to the *next step*. Here it checks if it *divisible by 5*. If **yes** the number is replaced by *pong* but if **not**, the number is taken to the *next step*. Here it is checked if it is *divisible by 3*. If **yes** it is replaced by *ping*, if **not** it is taken through the *last step* which states that if it is *divisible by neither* it is **returned as the number the user keyed in**.
